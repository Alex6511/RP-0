	description = As we prepare for orbit, horizontal velocity is equally as important as altitude. We need you to launch a suborbital rocket that can fly past the Waypoint marker to work on the proper turn angle for our eventual orbital launch.
		
	synopsis = Launch a suborbital rocket in the direction of the waypoint and at least reach that distance from the launch site.
		
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You have begun the process of developing your proper gravity turn.
