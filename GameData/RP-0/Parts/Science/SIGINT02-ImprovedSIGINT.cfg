	@description = The Improved Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Satellite is used to listen to transmissions coming from Earth. Historically, these were flown as SIGNIT Spy Satellites under the Vortex codename. Not much is known about the actual abilities of these satellites in real life, but the sizes are estimates based on known information.\nLevel 2 SIGINT Experiment. Can gather 70% of SIGINT Science.
