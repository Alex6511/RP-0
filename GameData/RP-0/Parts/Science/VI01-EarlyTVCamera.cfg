	description = The Early Television Camera is used to take images in the visibile wavelength of planetary bodies from space. This is a very early camera and lacks resolution in the images. Historically, these were flown on Explorer 6, which was the first craft to send images of Earth from orbit, and Luna 3 which was the first craft to return images from the far side of the Moon.\nThe images can be transmitted for full science value. Level 1 Visible Imaging Experiment can gather 10% of Visible Imaging Science. You can keep up to 5 different images in the storage available.
