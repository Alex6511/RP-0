You should not tool all of the parts -> It should really only be used for sizes you plan on using again
Plan ahead with your rocket builds, try to use similar diameters in order to maximize tooling
Tooling width (diameter) is much more expensive than tooling length -> It is far easier to stretch a tank
Forget everything you have ever learned from Stock KSP
Don't pay for the tooling of your parts until you have tested your rocket design
Remember to train your crew before you launch them on a mission
Some contracts require specific payloads. These are resources that can be put into "fuel tanks".
The rocket equation is cruel. Your rocket will usually be at least 85% of fuel.
