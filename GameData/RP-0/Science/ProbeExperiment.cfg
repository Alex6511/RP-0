//Creates a new experiment called "Probe Situation Report" that provides a small amount of science, can be
//performed anywhere, but is only biome specific when landed/splashed.  This experiment is designed to be
//added to probe cores and mimic basic telemetry data.  Basically giving a science value to the data you're
//ostensibly already using to pilot the probe.
