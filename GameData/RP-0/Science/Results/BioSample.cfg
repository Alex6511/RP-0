		//General
		EarthInSpaceLow = Fruit Flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are observed and determined that mating is possible without gravity.
		EarthInSpaceLow = Honey bees (Apis mellifica) are unable to fly normally and tumble in weightlessness.
		EarthInSpaceLow = The House flies (Muscus domestica ) mostly limited themselves to walking on the walls.  When they did fly, they could control motion in all three axes, although flight only lasted for a few seconds.
		EarthFlyingHigh = A bat showed little to no sign of trying to right itself, only showing some signs of distress at the unknown feeling of low gravity while falling back to earth. 
		EarthFlyingHigh = The high g-force reached during accent has had little effect on the 5 mice specimen.
		EarthFlyingLow = The plant sample show little signs of change. 
		EarthFlyingLow = A Squirrel Monkey, instrumented with electrodes to monitor his vital signs during the flight show all system go. 
		EarthInSpaceHigh = A developmental wing abnormality, appearing in adult Flour Beetles (Tribolium confusum) following pupal irradiation, was increased to 44.8% in flight, compared with control incidence of 29.9%. 
		EarthInSpaceHigh = Tadpoles swim in loops, rather than straight lines, because there is no up or down in microgravity to orient them.
		EarthInSpaceHigh = A Squirrel Monkey, instrumented with electrodes to monitor his vital signs during the flight show all system go.
		
		// ** Moon
		//General
		MoonInSpaceLow = The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is observed and determined that developmental processes and morphogenesis appear to be normal.
		MoonInSpaceLow = The bio container consisting of several tree seeds (Loblolly Pine, Sycamore, Sweetgum, Redwood, and Douglas Fir) will be studied in an effort to understand how radiation exposure will effect growth.
		MoonInSpaceHigh = A developmental wing abnormality, appearing in adult Flour Beetles (Tribolium confusum) following pupal irradiation, was increased to 44.8% in flight, compared with control incidence of 29.9%. 
		MoonInSpaceHigh = Tadpoles swim in loops, rather than straight lines, because there is no up or down in microgravity to orient them.
		MoonInSpaceLow = An orb-weaving spider has initially woven an aimless concoction during the first days in weightlessness.
		//Lowlands
		MoonSrfLandedLowlands = Remotely, water will be added to basil, turnip, and Arabidopsis (a small flowering plant) seeds kept in the bio container, then monitored and compared to controls back on Earth. 
		MoonSrfLandedLowlands = An on-board centrifuge applies gravitational accelerations to green alga. In the alga(Chara rhizoids), accelerations of 0.14 g resulted in a displacement of statoliths toward the cell wall in the periphery of the cells, while acceleration of 0.05 g did not result in statolith movement. 
		//Highlands
		
		//Midlands
		MoonSrfLandedMidlands = An on-board centrifuge applies gravitational accelerations to green alga. In the alga(Chara rhizoids), accelerations of 0.14 g resulted in a displacement of statoliths toward the cell wall in the periphery of the cells, while acceleration of 0.05 g did not result in statolith movement.

		//Lunar Seas
		MoonSrfLandedLunarSeas = The bio container consisting of several tree seeds (Loblolly Pine, Sycamore, Sweetgum, Redwood, and Douglas Fir) will be studied in an effort to understand how radiation exposure will effect growth.

		// **** Mars
		//General
		MarsInSpaceLow = On the long journey to Mars, ants ability to explore their environment was greatly affected by lack of gravity. However, the creatures showed an "impressive ability" to crawl on the surface of their container.
		MarsInSpaceLow = During the journey to Mars, ants showed a remarkable ability to regain contact with the surface once they tumbled and floated away. In some cases an ant would grab onto an another ant buddy in order to pull itself back down to the surface.
