		// **** Earth
		//General
		EarthInSpaceLow = It's amazing how well the camera picks up the light of the cities below. The world looks like a living organism.
		EarthInSpaceLow = Earth is just spectacular when viewed from space. It's teeming with diversity, with beauty, amazing colors, the blues and the greens and the whites.
		EarthInSpaceHigh = The cloud layer looks almost featureless at this altitude.
		EarthInSpaceHigh = Almost surreal: the northern LIGHTS.
				
		//Grasslands
		EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = A large blaze raging its way through the grasslands can be seen with frightening clarity at the center of this image.
		
		//Highlands
		EarthInSpaceLowHighlands = You can see big, fluffy pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which is occuring over a volcanic eruption in this image.
		
		//Mountains
		EarthInSpaceLowMountains = Below, thousands of miles of almost virgin forest.
		
		//Desert
		EarthInSpaceLowDesert = Seen here is a daily pulse of dust rising off the desert. It's visible as a whitish dust cloud, lifting from the desert, with clockwork regularity. The dust cloud is over 200 miles wide by estimate.
		EarthInSpaceLowDesert = The lack of vegetation in the Desert beautifully exposes the geology of the area. The stripes and swirls are layers of rock that have been folded and deformed by tectonic forces and flattened by wind erosion over time.
		
		//Tropics
		EarthInSpaceHighTropics = Seen here in each frame of the photo, where one frame is equal to a day, it shows how water vapor produced at the equator continuously transports the sun's energy towards the poles.
		
		//Poles
		EarthInSpaceLowPoles = The poles remain earth's last great wilderness: a vast frozen emptyness, plunged in darkness.
		EarthInSpaceLowPoles = The waters off the coast are covered in a beautiful, swirly pattern of sea ice.
		
		
		//Water
		EarthInSpaceLowWater = The hot tower of clouds draw more and more water vapor off the ocean. This triggers a huge hurricane which has grown into a Category 5 monster.
		
		//Shores
		EarthInSpaceLowShores = Island mountains disturb the otherwise fairly uniform airflow over the ocean creating v-shapes in the clouds. The stripes in the wakes are the crests and troughs of the the air flow.


		// ** Moon
		//General
		MooninSpaceLow = Younger craters are superimposed over older ones. Our scientists should be able to use this to determine the relative ages of impact craters.
		MooninSpaceHigh = Everything looks gray and the lunar surface is heavily cratered.
		MooninSpaceHigh = From this altitude, their is a disctinct difference in the smooth, dark mare and a heavily-cratered, light-colored highland region.
		
		//Lowlands
		MooninSpaceLowLowlands = A rounded, circular features with a gentle slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint is observed.

		//Highlands
		MooninSpaceLowHighlands = 	This lighter area of the Moon is heavily cratered terrain covering most of the surface.	
		MooninSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands geology is mostly composed of overlapping layers of material ejected from the many craters.
		
		//Midlands
		MooninSpaceLowMidlands = Despite being relatively flat, the Midlands are still littered with debris from impact ejecta, making choosing a landing site a non-trivial matter.

		//Lunar Seas
		MooninSpaceLowLunarSeas =   This dark, relatively smooth area of the Moon contrasts with the heavily cratered terrain covering most of the surface.

		//Major Craters
		MooninSpaceLowMajorCraters = Large impact craters pock mark much of the surface of the Moon.
		MooninSpaceLowMajorCraters = Features are noted that represent buckling of the surface and form long ridges.
		
		
		//Far Side Basin
		MooninSpaceLowFarSideBasin = This low-lying area is heavily cratered.
		MooninSpaceLowFarSideBasin = This photo displays the characteristic features of a large impact formation, with a raised rim, slumped edges, terraced inner walls, a relatively flat floor with some hills, and a central ridge. 
		MooninSpaceHighFarSideBasin = The most striking geological feature between the hemispheres is the nearside is low and flat, whereas the farside is mountainous and deeply cratered.
		
		//North Pole
		MooninSpaceLowNorthPole =  The cratered North Pole of the Moon might harbor water ice deposits.
		
		//South Pole
		MooninSpaceLowSouthPole =  Some areas near the pole are in dark shadows all of the time. There might be water ice in some of those shady places.
