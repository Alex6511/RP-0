		// **** Venus
		//General
		VenusFlyingLow = Our sensors are experiencing extreme heating cycles, with temperatures rising by over 100ºC during several 100 second-long passages through the atmosphere.
		VenusSrfLanded = The greenhouse effect of the atmosphere is keeping the surface at 740K (467C). Our insturments won't last long at that temperature.
