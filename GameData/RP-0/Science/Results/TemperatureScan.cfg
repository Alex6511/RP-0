		// **** Mercury
		//General
		MercuryFlyingHigh = The temperatures appear to vary greatly, from 100.2 K (-173 C) on the night side to nearly over 692.2 K (425 C) on the day side.
		MercuryFlyingLow = With almost no atmosphere to retain heat, temperatures appear to vary greatly, from 100.2 K (-173 C) on the night side to nearly over 692.2 K (425 C) on the day side.
		MercurySrfLanded = Temperatures are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C) at the landing site.
		
		//Lunar Seas
		
		//Major Craters
		MercurySrfLandedMajorCraters = The crater's rim cast a shadow on the landing site.  Here the temperature measures 108.8 K (-164.4 C).
		MercurySrfLandedMajorCraters = The temperatures appear to vary greatly, from 100.2 K (-173 C) in the crater's shadow to nearly over 692.2 K (425 C) in the daylight.
		
		//Far Side Basin
		
		//North Pole
		MercuryFlyingLowNorthPole = Day and Night have little impact on temperatures; they average a constant 180 K (-93 C).
		MercuryFlyingHighNorthPole = Temperatures appear to be holding constant at 195 K (-78.2 C).
		MercurySrfLandedNorthPole = Temperatures are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C).
		
		//South Pole
		MercuryFlyingLowSouthPole = Day and Night cycles have little impact on temperatures; they average a constant 180 K (-93 C).
		MercuryFlyingHighSouthPole = Temperatures appear to be holding constant at 195 K (-78.2 C).

		// **** Venus
		//General
		VenusFlyingLow = Our sensors are experiencing extreme heating cycles, with temperatures rising by over 100ºC during several 100 second-long passages through the atmosphere.
		VenusSrfLanded = The greenhouse effect of the atmosphere is keeping the surface at 740K (467C). Our insturments won't last long at that temperature.

		//Far Side Basin
		MoonSrfLandedFarSideBasin = The surface here consists of multiple types of rock. Some appear almost crystalline.

		//North Pole
		MoonSrfLandedNorthPole = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realise that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you've collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
