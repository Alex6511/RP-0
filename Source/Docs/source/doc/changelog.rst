RP-1 v.1.00 for KSP 1.3.1
-------------------------

Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Tech Tree**
  
  - RP-1 has a brand new tech tree that was designed specifically for RP-1 gameplay. It has a unique structure and contains Blue Sky Reasearch nodes that gate future technologies.
  - Begins with 1950's technology and progresses to the Near Future
  - The tree is a "whitelist" tree only. No parts will show up in the game unless they have been specifically added to the tree.
- **Science Overhaul**
  - All science parts have been changed and there are new experiments for you to utilize.
  - There is a progression of science returns that can happen in different fields. This means that your science parts from the early part of the tech tree will only give you a portion of the total available science. This encourages the player to send multiple missions to other planetary bodies.
- **Tooling**
  - Tooling costs have been added in order to encourage the player to re-use rocket and stage designs.
  - The tanks from Procedural Parts and SSTU are supported with the current tooling setup.
- **Maintenance**
  - Your astronauts and your facilities cost money. You cannot just skip ahead without paying these recurring costs. The more advanced your facilities are, the more expensive maintenance is.
- **Crew Handling**
  - You must handle your crew in very different ways from previous versions of RP-0 and any other KSP you have played.
  - Your crew will requiring training to use on missions
  - Eventually your astronauts will retire, especially if they are not used on missions.
- **Facility Upgrades**
  - The launchpad and the R&D building can both be updated to 7 levels.
- **Rollout Costs**
  - These costs are always going to be higher than the cost of the parts and that is the intended function.
  - The costs represent the integration of parts together, the testing, the assembly of the rocket and all of the things that are required to get a rocket launched. The "cost" in the VAB is simply the cost to create the raw part.

There are so many other changes that are too numerous to mention, but a big thanks goes out to the entire team of developers and testers that have put in countless hours getting RP-1 to where it is today.

Special thanks to NathanKell and pjf for getting this whole thing started so many years ago
