Realistic Progression One (RP-1)
================================

Welcome!
--------

Realistic Progression One (RP-1) is a career mode addon for 
the `Realism Overhaul`_ suite of mods for `Kerbal Space Program`_.

RP-1 is the quasi-successor to RP-0. There have been many changes
from RP-0 to RP-1 and the game plays much differently. It was decided
that it deserved a new name, and RP-1 was born. Where RP-0 called
itself the "lightweight career add-on", RP-1 is most definitely not.
It offers a completely different experience from most anything
else that is available for `Kerbal Space Program`_.

What is New?

A lot has changed from RP-0 and this is a concise list of some of the
